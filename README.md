Problem Statement: 
To create a program to find the Shear force and Bending moment developed in a specimen while conducting the experiment using Python Programing language with the use of Numpy library.
Operations using NumPy:
Using NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations −
	Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
	Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.
	Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.


NumPy – A Replacement for MatLab:
NumPy is often used along with packages like SciPy (Scientific Python) and Mat−plotlib (plotting library). This combination is widely used as a replacement for MatLab, a popular platform for technical computing. However, Python alternative to MatLab is now seen as a more modern and complete programming language.
It is open source, which is an added advantage of NumPy.

Theory: 
The problem which is taken in the case study is related to Strength of Material. Hence some points related to shear force and bending moment explained below:
Shear Forces occurs when two parallel forces act out of alignment with each other. For example, in a large boiler made from sections of sheet metal plate riveted together, there is an equal and opposite force exerted on the rivets, owing to the expansion and contraction of the plates. Bending Moments are rotational forces within the beam that cause bending. At any point within a beam, the Bending Moment is the sum of: each external force multiplied by the distance that is perpendicular to the direction of the force.
      The shearing force (SF) at any section of a beam represents the tendency for the portion of the beam on one side of the section to slide or shear laterally relative to the other portion.

In a similar manner it can be seen that if the Bending moments (BM) of the forces to the left of AA are clockwise, then the bending moment of the forces to the right of AA must be anticlockwise. Bending Moment at AA is defined as the algebraic sum of the moments about the section of all forces acting on either side of the section.

	Real life problem:    This problem is related to Strength of Material
Members ABC and BD of the counter chair are rigidly connected at B and smooth collar at D is allowed to move freely along the vertical slot. Draw the share and moment diagram for member ABC.
